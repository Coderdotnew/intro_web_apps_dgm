# calculator_project
- Challenge: Build a Command Line Calculator application
- Group size: 2-4 students
# pre-code
- When working on any project, it is always best to consider how your calculator will operate  
-- What operations will it include?  
-- Will it include a menu?  
-- What methods are required?  
- Before coding, use **pseudo code** to hash out any challenges you might predict so that when you get to writing your methods, everything is logically sound
- Consider everyone in your group and switch up who is the "driver" to give everyone an opportunity to contribute to the project

(I mean, we've all used a calculator for the at some point...)  

# mvp
**MVP**: Minimal Viable Product. This term is widely used when introducing and building new features and applications. This term is extremely important because it is easy to get ahead of ourselves when building something new. We usually want to do too much too quickly...   

When building your calculator, first determine your MVP, *what is the most basic functioning version of your calculator do you want to have done?*.   

Once this is complete, then you begin to add features to your MVP. The goal is for everyone to have a fully functional MVP command line calculator by the end of class, even if it simply adds and subtracts.

# challenges
Feel free to add to your calculator once you have an MVP  
1. A calculator that can take 2 numbers input as arguments  
2. A calucator that can do complex math fucntions  
3. A calculator that runs on a loop and only exits if a user inputs "exit"  
4. A calculator that can take up to 5 number inputs as arguments (i.e. 2 + 2 or 2 + 2 + 2 or 3 + 5 + 6 + 7, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)  

##### GOOD LUCK!
