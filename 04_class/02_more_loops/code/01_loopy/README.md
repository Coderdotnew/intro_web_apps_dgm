# loopy
The goal of this challenge is to practice returning the same value using various loops.  

Each loop should output the following to the Terminal screen when `rspec` is run.
```ruby
# This is loop 1
# This is loop 2
# This is loop 3
# This is loop 4
# This is loop 5
# This is loop 6
# This is loop 7
# This is loop 8
# This is loop 9
# This is loop 10
#=> "Now you're a loop master!"
```
